## Vue Concepts Used

### Transition Components

Transition components are utilized in FoodBar to create smooth transitions when switching between different views or components. This enhances the user experience by providing seamless visual effects.

### Transition Components JavaScript Hook

The `transition` tag in Vue.js is employed along with JavaScript hooks to control the transition behavior programmatically. This enables custom animations and transitions based on specific events in the application.

### Emitting Events from Child Components

In FoodBar, child components emit events to communicate with their parent components. This allows for dynamic interaction between different parts of the application, such as updating the selected dish in the carousel based on user input.
